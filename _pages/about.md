About Me
======
Hi there! I'm Tamalika Das, a Bioinformatician  with a keen interest in Single-Cell Transcriptomics. I pursued my Masters in Bioinformatics from Banaras Hindu University, India. For my Master's dissertation, I worked with Dr. Rakesh Pandey in the Quantitative and Systems Biology Lab on inferring cell-type specific Gene Regulatory Networks in PBMCs and understanding the role of hub genes. I'm currently looking for positions in cancer research.

Research interests
======
- **Single-Cell Transcriptomics**: Analyzing gene expression at the single-cell level to uncover cellular heterogeneity and function.
- **Cancer Genomics**: Investigating genetic alterations in cancer to identify potential therapeutic targets and understand tumorigenesis.
- **Network Biology**: Exploring the complex interactions within biological networks to understand the underlying mechanisms of health and disease.

Projects
------

Gene Regulatory Network
======
- Gene Regulatory Network Analysis: Identification and analysis of cell-type specific GRNs using single-cell RNA sequencing data from PBMCs.
- In Silico Knockout Simulations: Simulation of gene knockouts, specifically targeting the EP300 gene, to study its impact on cellular pathways and development of Megakaryocytes.
- CellOracle Tool: Utilization of the CellOracle tool for GRN inference and knockout simulation.

For more details, you can check out the GitHub repository of my Master's dissertation :(https://github.com/Tamalikaaa18/SingleCell-GRN-InsilicoPerturbation).

Co-expression Network
======
- Co-expression Tool: Identified and evaluated a suitable tool for constructing single-cell co-expression networks, focusing on its capabilities and user-friendliness for biological data analysis.
- Initial Results : Applied the co-expression network tool to initial datasets from my research, conducting preliminary analysis to assess network structure and potential gene relationships.
